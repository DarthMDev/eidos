/*
 * tests/test_mod_text.c -- the port's own text path: the side of the
 * message service that puts the text on the screen (sdk/mod_text.h;
 * docs/mod-services.md, "Messages").
 *
 * The message service (sdk/mod_message.c) owns the queue and the encoding;
 * the port's text path (sdk/mod_text.c) is the sink the service shows a
 * text through: it builds the game's own string object out of the code
 * units and prints it in the game's own window, in the game's own font.
 * What this test checks is the contract between the two:
 *
 *   - the order: the texts reach the sink in the order they were queued,
 *     one per message point, and an empty queue shows nothing;
 *   - the code units: the sink is handed the units the service encoded,
 *     and the game's string object carries them with the end code the port
 *     adds when it builds the object;
 *   - the answer: a question is asked through the yes/no window the
 *     overlay hands over, and the answer comes back to the call that waits
 *     for it;
 *   - the font: a character the game font lacks shows as '?', and the
 *     port's text path answers the service with the font's own table.
 *
 * Nothing here needs game data: the game's own string object, print queue
 * and font are weak in sdk/mod_text.c, so the test supplies its own and
 * watches what the port's text path hands them.
