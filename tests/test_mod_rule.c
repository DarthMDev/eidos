/*
 * tests/test_mod_rule.c -- the rule interpreter: a rule file, the event it
 * binds to and the actions it runs (docs/mod-rules-language.md).
 *
 * A rule is a guarded action at one event, written in the rule language and
 * compiled by the port at load (docs/mod-rules-language.md, sections 2 and
 * 4).  The port's side of that is sdk/mod_rule.c; the contract it keeps is
 * the one of the document:
 *
 *   - a good rule file compiles, and the rule binds to the event it names;
 *   - the rule runs as a handler like any other: its guard decides whether
 *     its actions run, its actions change the payload the game sees, and a
 *     `refuse` action refuses the event;
 *   - a file with a syntax error is refused at load;
 *   - a rule whose event is unknown is refused at load, and so is a rule
 *     whose file names another event than the manifest binds it to;
 *   - the step budget: a firing may execute at most 256 steps, and a rule
 *     that reaches it stops for that firing without refusing.
 *
 * Nothing here needs game data: the rules are text the test writes into a
 * directory of its own, and the payload they act on is the test's own.
