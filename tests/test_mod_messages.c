/*
 * tests/test_mod_messages.c -- the message service: the text on screen
 * (docs/mod-services.md, "Messages"; sdk/mod_message.h).
 *
 * A mod puts text on the player's screen through the service's two calls
 * (sdk/mod_state.h, the services table): `message` shows one window and
 * `confirm` asks a yes/no question.  The port queues both: the text appears
 * at the next point where the game would accept a message, so a handler
 * never draws over the game.
 *
 * What is checked here:
 *
 *   - the queue's order: the texts come out in the order they were queued,
 *     the queue says how many are waiting, and an empty queue gives
 *     nothing;
 *   - the show step: the port's pump takes the next text and shows it
 *     through the sink, which is the port's hook into the game's text path;
 *   - a confirm's answer: the question is asked and the player's answer
 *     comes back, 1 for yes and 0 for no;
 *   - the encoding: the text is a run of the game's 16-bit code units, and
 *     a character the game font lacks is a '?';
 *   - a confirm in a battle returns 0 at once: the battle's message box
 *     cannot ask a question, so the answer is "no" and the question is
 *     never asked.
 *
 * Nothing here needs game data: the port's own text path is driven through
 * the sink, not the game's windows.
