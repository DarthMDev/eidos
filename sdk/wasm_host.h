/*
 * sdk/wasm_host.h -- what the wasm32 build of eidos asks of the program
 * that runs it (docs/lp64.md, "The wasm32 configuration's architecture").
 *
 * In the wasm32 configuration the game, the port and the engine are one
 * WebAssembly module, translated to C by wasm2c and run inside a native
 * 64-bit program (host/).  Everything the module cannot do by itself is a
 * function the host provides, declared here: the module's imports from
 * the "eidos" module.  The C library's own (files, the clock, the
 * environment) are WASI's, which the host provides too.
 *
 * Fibers.  The module runs on one host thread.  Each of its threads
 * (sdk/plat_thread.c, the wasm32 part) is a fiber of the host: its own
 * native stack for the translated code, and its own part of linear memory
 * for the module's stack.  A switch is a call that returns when the fiber
 * that made it is switched to again; the host keeps each fiber's module
 * stack pointer (__stack_pointer) and puts the next one's in place.  A new
 * fiber starts in the module's export bw_fiber_main(id).
 *
 * Only for the wasm32 build: nothing includes this file elsewhere.
