 * sdk/mod_loader.h -- the port's loader (docs/mod-implementation.md,

 *
 * The loader opens a mod's library, checks the versions, calls the mod's
 * start-up with the host table, and installs the mod's overrides.  On the
 * way down it reverts the slots the mod installed, calls the mod's stop and
 * unloads the library.
 *
 * The load point is after the save is chosen and before the game runs; the
 * stop is on exit and when the player disables a mod.
