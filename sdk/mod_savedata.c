/*
 * sdk/mod_savedata.c -- a mod's own saved data: the file it lives in, the
 * envelope around it, and the versions it carries (docs/mod-state.md,
 * sections 1, 2 and 5).
 *
 * What this file is:
 *
 *   - the state namespace: one folder per mod under the save directory,
 *     <save dir>/mods/<namespace>/, and one state file per game save in
 *     it, <save>.bin, so a mod's data always belongs to the save it was
 *     written with;
 *   - the envelope: the port's own 24-byte header (BwModStateHeader,
 *     sdk/mod_state.h) followed by the mod's opaque payload.  The port
 *     owns the header and the mod never sees it; the mod owns the bytes
 *     after it;
 *   - the versions: a file older than the port's is read with its own
 *     payload size and rewritten in the current version, a file newer
 *     than the port's is not read and is moved aside, and a file the
 *     port cannot read is moved aside and reported;
 *   - the six calls the services table carries (sdk/mod_state.h,
 *     BwModServices): state_load, state_store, state_clear, state_info,
 *     state_dir and state_in_step.
 *
 * The write discipline is the port's own whole-file atomic write
 * (bw_save_write_atomic, sdk/save.h): a temporary file, a sync and the
 * replace.  The unit of that discipline is one file, so one file per mod:
 * a region per mod inside one shared file would move every later region
 * when one mod's format changed, and a bad write in one region would
 * damage another mod's bytes (docs/mod-state.md, section 1).
 *
 * The file is written, not patched: a store replaces the whole file, so
 * there is no partial state, and a file the port cannot read is moved
 * aside rather than deleted, so a player can recover it.
 *
 * Who calls what:
 *
 *   - the loader (sdk/mod_loader.c) tells the layer which mod is calling
 *     (bw_mod_savedata_set_namespace) and which manifest api is in force
 *     (bw_mod_savedata_set_api), and binds the six calls below into the
 *     mod's services table.  The namespace is set around every call the
 *     port makes into a mod, so a mod's state call always knows whose
 *     file it is about;
 *   - the port tells the layer the checksum of the game save in force
 *     (bw_mod_savedata_set_save_check) and drives the save handoff
 *     (bw_mod_savedata_save_begin and bw_mod_savedata_save_done);
 *   - the session area's rows drive the save window (sdk/
 *     mod_event_session.c): the game's own save.begin opens it and the
 *     game's own save.done closes it, so the window is the game's save
 *     and not the menu's apply.
 *
 * The window and the save in force
 * -------------------------------
 *
 * The port's own save state is the backup chip's image (sdk/arm7/fs.c),
 * the game's save as the port holds it.  The layer reads it when the
 * window opens and when the window closes, and takes its CRC-32: the
 * checksum the window opens with is the checksum of the save in force
 * while the window is open, and the one it closes with is the checksum
 * of the save the game has just written, which is the checksum the
 * mod's own files are written with (docs/mod-state.md, section 2, "The
 * lifecycle").  A mod's file therefore says which game save it was
 * written with, and state_in_step answers for the mod that calls it
 * whether that file was written with the save in force: the answer is
 * per mod, because every mod has a file of its own.
 *
 * One rule takes that checksum: the CRC-32 of the save's bytes as the
 * chip holds them.  The chip's image is the save file's first <chip
 * size> bytes with the rest of the chip erased (0xFF, sdk/arm7/fs.c),
 * so the checksum of the chip's image and the checksum of the save's
 * bytes are one number when the rule is applied to both.  The handoff
 * (sdk/mod_handoff.c) installs a save and drops the chip's image, so
 * it cannot read the image afterwards; it gives the layer the bytes it
 * installed and the layer takes their checksum the same way.  One
 * source, one answer: a file with a trailer, or one shorter than the
 * chip, cannot make the two disagree about whether a mod's file is in
 * step with the save in force.
 *
 * The layer keeps no game state of its own: it is a file and an envelope
 * around a payload the mod owns.
 *
 * The window and a save that was cancelled
 * -----------------------------------------
 *
 * The window is the game's own save: the game's save.begin opens it and
 * the game's save.done closes it (sdk/mod_event_session.c).  The game's
 * own SAVE_CONTROL_CancelSave has no row, so the port hears nothing
 * when the player cancels a save: the window stays open, and the next
 * save.begin finds it open.  A window that is still open when a save
 * begins belongs to a save that never finished, so the port closes it
 * and drops the payload it held, the way a failed write drops it: a
 * save that did not happen writes nothing.  The port cannot tell a
 * cancelled save from a save that is still in progress at that moment,
 * and it does not have to: a new save begins only after the old one is
 * over.
