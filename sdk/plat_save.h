/*
 * sdk/plat_save.h -- the host calls the save files need that standard C does
 * not have: where a platform keeps a player's saves, making that folder, and
 * replacing a file in one step.
 *
 * Why a file of its own: the save layer (sdk/save.h) writes a new image
 * beside the old one and swaps it in, so a crash or a power cut leaves
 * either the old save or the new one and never half of each.  C99's rename
 * may refuse to replace an existing file (it does on Windows), and it has
 * neither mkdir nor a way to push a file's bytes to the disk.  Those three
 * and the platform's save folder are the only OS-specific pieces, so they
 * live here behind #ifdefs for Win32 and POSIX, the arrangement of
 * sdk/plat_dir.c and sdk/plat_thread.c.  Paths are narrow strings, forward
 * slashes accepted everywhere, as the rest of the file layer passes them.
