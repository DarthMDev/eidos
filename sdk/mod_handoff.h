/*
 * sdk/mod_handoff.h -- the save handoff: a save passed from one player's
 * eidos to another's (docs/mod-services.md, "Save handoff"; docs/mod-modes.md,
 * section 3, "Save handoff"; docs/modding.md, section 3).
 *
 * What this file is:
 *
 *   - the two calls the services table carries: bw_mod_handoff_send sends
 *     the current game save and the mod's own saved data to another player
 *     in the session, and bw_mod_handoff_on_save binds the handler that is
 *     told when a save arrives;
 *   - the port's own seams: the confirmation the receiver's port shows, the
 *     reload that follows it, and the binding that puts the port's own
 *     session handler in place (the peer session hands the port's own
 *     traffic to the port, sdk/mod_net.c).
 *
 * The rules the service keeps (docs/mod-services.md, "Save handoff"; the
 * words are the document's):
 *
 *   - "Sends the current game save and the mod's saved data to another
 *     player in the session."
 *   - "The receiver's port shows a confirmation, then installs the save and
 *     reloads."
 *
 * A Taglocke passes the run from player to player this way.
 *
 * The API here is the port's own; the services table in sdk/mod_state.h
 * carries the two calls a mod reaches.

 * is the one the namespace in force names (the loader puts a mod's
 * namespace in force around every call it makes into that mod).  The mod's
 * own data is the data of that mod, and the peer that receives the save
 * gives it to the mod with the same name on its side.
 *
 * The call returns when the save is on its way: the pieces go out over the

 * peer session's own answers when it was not (sdk/mod_net.h):
