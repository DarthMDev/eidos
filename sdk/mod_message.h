/*
 * sdk/mod_message.h -- the message service: the text a mod puts on screen
 * (docs/mod-services.md, "Messages"; docs/mod-implementation.md, section 6,
 * step 8).
 *
 * What this is
 * ------------
 *
 * The first of the port's services (docs/mod-services.md).  A mod calls
 * `message` to say something to the player and `confirm` to ask a question;
 * the port shows the text in the game's own windows, in the game's font, at
 * a point where the game would accept a message, so a handler never draws
 * over the game.
 *
 * The rules the service keeps (docs/mod-services.md):
 *
 *   - The text appears in the field's talk window, or in the battle message
 *     box during a battle.
 *   - It is queued: the port shows it at the next point where the game
 *     would accept a message (after the current script command, or at the
 *     next battle message).
 *   - A confirm is only allowed in the field; in a battle it returns 0 at
 *     once.
 *   - The text is UTF-8; a character the game font lacks shows as '?'.
 *   - A message from a refusal handler appears after the action is refused:
 *     the handler queues the text while the action is refused, and the
 *     queue is drained at the next message point, which is after it.
 *
 * The text's encoding
 * -------------------
 *
 * The game's text is a run of 16-bit code units, not a run of bytes.  The
 * message bank's strings are code units (src/game/arm9/msgdata.c), and the
 * game prints them with its own font: one unit is one character, 0xFFFF
 * ends a string and 0xFFFE is a line break.  The printable ASCII range is
 * the same number as the byte; a character the font lacks shows as '?'.
 *
 * bw_mod_message_encode() turns a UTF-8 string into those units.  It does
 * not write the end code: the port's text path appends it when it builds
 * the game's string object.
 *
 * The show step
 * -------------
 *
 * The queue is the service's own.  The *showing* is the port's hook into
 * the game's text path, which is a separate piece of work: the port
 * installs a sink (bw_mod_message_set_sink) and calls
 * bw_mod_message_pump() where the game would accept a message.  The sink
 * does the three things the game does with a text: show it, ask it, and
 * advance the game to the next message point.
 *
 * This header is the port's own; a mod never sees it.  What a mod sees is
 * the services table (sdk/mod_state.h), whose two message calls the loader
 * binds to bw_mod_message_show() and bw_mod_message_confirm().
