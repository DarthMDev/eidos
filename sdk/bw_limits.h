/*
 * sdk/bw_limits.h -- the game's content limits, raised by mods.
 *
 * aletheia names each limit the game tests against (src/game/port_limits.h:
 * `ITEM_LAST` is `BW_LIMIT(ITEM_LAST, 626)`).  On the DS the name is the
 * original number; in the port it calls bw_limit_get, answered here.
 *
 * A limit is the vanilla value, raised to the highest value any enabled mod
 * declares in its manifest (`limit.items = 700`), capped at the ceiling the
 * game's storage allows.  Where new content goes is the mod author's choice;
 * the port only raises the limit (docs/mods.md, "Adding content").
 *
 * Tables the game holds with one row per id (the item icon table) cannot
 * grow by raising a number.  The port replaces them with copies that have
 * a row for every id up to the limit: the vanilla rows, then the rows mods
 * give in `<mod>/eidos/tables/<table>.txt` (`<id> = <value> <value> ...`),
 * a later mod winning per row.
