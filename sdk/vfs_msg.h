/*
 * sdk/vfs_msg.h -- line level merge for text banks.
 *
 * A text bank (a member of a/0/0/2 or a/0/0/3) holds one string per id, so a
 * mod that adds one species name should not have to ship the whole encoded
 * bank, and two mods that each add a name should not clobber one another.
 * Instead a mod ships a plain text file `<bank index>.msg` in the directory
 * at the message archive's path, for example `<mod>/a/0/0/2/70.msg`.
 *
 * File grammar (UTF-8):
 *
 *   - One entry per line: `<index> = <text>`.  The index is decimal.  One
 *     space after the `=` is skipped; the text then runs to the end of the
 *     line and keeps its trailing spaces.  A CR before the LF is dropped.
 *   - A line whose first character is `#` is a comment.  An empty line, or
 *     one holding only spaces and tabs, is ignored.
 *   - The text uses the display form of the kenon tools:
 *       `\n`               the line break unit 0xFFFE
 *       `{KIND}`           control code F000, KIND, argument count 0
 *       `{KIND:a,b,...}`   control code F000, KIND, count, the arguments
 *                          (hex, 1 to 4 digits each, any case; the tools
 *                          write KIND with 4 digits)
 *       `{U+XXXX}`         one raw unit (an unpaired surrogate)
 *       `\\`, `\{`, `\}`   the literal character; any other `\x` is an error
 *       anything else      its UTF-16 code units
 *     The 0xFFFF terminator is added by the encoder, so it cannot be written.
 *   - A line whose text starts with `{packed}` is refused in this version.
 *
 * Merge: later mods win per line.  An index past the bank's count grows
 * the bank and the indices in between become empty strings.  Lines nobody
 * touches keep their original ciphertext bytes.  Changed lines are enciphered
 * with key (u16)((index + 3) * 0x2983), rotated left by 3 after each unit.
 * The bank header and the offset table are rebuilt.
