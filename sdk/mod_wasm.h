/*
 * sdk/mod_wasm.h -- code mods built for WebAssembly (docs/mod-code-wasm.md).
 *
 * A mod's `code` file is a native library or a wasm module; the loader
 * (sdk/mod_loader.c) tells them apart by the module's magic and hands a
 * module to this layer.  The module runs in WAMR's interpreter.  It reaches
 * the port through the imports of module "eidos" (sdk/api/v4/core.json and
 * eidos_wasm.h): the core calls (log, on, script, memory access) and one
 * import per state call and service, the same table a native mod is
 * handed.
 *
 * A build without the runtime (tools/fetch_wamr.py was not run) keeps this
 * interface: bw_mod_wasm_available answers 0 and every module is refused
 * with a message.
