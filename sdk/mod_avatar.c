/*
 * sdk/mod_avatar.c -- the field avatars: the other player's figure in the
 * local field (docs/mod-services.md, "Field avatars"; docs/mod-coop.md,
 * sections 1 to 4).
 *
 * What this file is
 * -----------------
 *
 * The port's side of the field avatar service.  A mod asks for an avatar
 * (the other player's figure), moves it and deletes it; the port makes a
 * field entity in the game's own entity pool for it, the game draws and
 * animates it with its own code, and the local game never notices it.
 *
 * The rules it keeps
 * ------------------
 *
 *   - The avatar is a field entity of the game's own: a record of the
 *     FLDMMDL system (src/game/ov010/fldmmdl.c), made the way the game
 *     makes a person of a zone (FLDMMDL_AddMmdl 0x0216CE60 into
 *     FLDMMDL_AddMmdlCore 0x0216CDC4).  The game draws it and animates it
 *     with its own code, so the avatar looks like the game's own people.
 *   - The object id is outside the game's own range, and the record has no
 *     event.  The zone's people have the object ids of the zone's event
 *     data and the player has 0xFF; the port's ids start at 0x8000.  The
 *     talk check reads the event id (FLDMMDL_GetEventId) and acts only
 *     when it is a zone script id (SCRIPT_SYS_IsZoneScriptId), and the
 *     avatar's event id is the game's own "no event" 0xFFFF, so the player
 *     cannot talk to an avatar and no script ever runs for one.
 *   - The hit checks leave it alone: the port sets the fellow-hit bit
 *     (MMDL_STABIT_FELLOW_HIT_OFF), the bit the game sets on a model that
 *     has already moved, so the people of the zone walk through the avatar
 *     and it never blocks one of them.
 *   - The port moves it smoothly between the positions the mod sends.  The
 *     mod sends a cell a few times a second (docs/mod-coop.md, section 2);
 *     the port walks the avatar from the cell it is in to the cell the mod
 *     named, a step a frame (bw_mod_avatar_frame, the port's own frame
 *     call), and the game draws it where the port put it.
 *   - The avatars go away at every map change.  The field empties its pool
 *     at a map change and adds the people of the new zone afterwards, so
 *     the route.change event (the field area's row, sdk/mod_event_field.c)
 *     is where the port's reset (bw_mod_avatar_reset) belongs: the
 *     avatars the game has already deleted are only forgotten, and the mod
 *     recreates the ones in the new zone.
 *
 * The two open questions of docs/mod-coop.md, section 4
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The pool's headroom and the sprite.  Both are answered from the game's
 * own code and both are in the report; the short answers are:
 *
 *   - The pool holds 64 records.  FLDMMDL_CreateSys 0x0216CC58 is called
 *     with 0x40 (src/game/arm9/game_data.c), and FLDMMDL_SysGetMmdlMax
 *     0x0216D4F0 answers the size at run time.  The game does not check
 *     the free slot before it takes it -- FLDMMDL_AddMmdlCore writes to
 *     the record FLDMMDL_SysGetFreeMmdl 0x0216DEEC answered, and that
 *     answer is 0 when the pool is full -- so the port asks for the free
 *     slot itself and answers 0 when there is no room.  The port also
 *     leaves a few slots free, so the zone's own people, which the game
 *     adds right after the route.change event, always fit.
 *
 *   - Two copies of the player's sprite can be resident at once.  The
 *     resource tables are keyed by the object code (FLDMMDL_BLACT_AddResIndex
 *     and FLDMMDL_G3DOBJ_AddResEntry), so one object code is one resident
 *     resource, and every model with that code is another instance of it
 *     (FLDMMDL_CheckSameObjCodeOther keeps the resource alive while a
 *     second model with the same code is in the pool).  The avatar is made
 *     with the player's own object code (1 the hero, 4 the heroine,
 *     FIELD_PLAYER_OBJ_CODE_HERO and FIELD_PLAYER_OBJ_CODE_HEROINE,
 *     src/game/ov021/field_player_types.h), and the map has already loaded
 *     that sprite (FIELDMAP_SetupMmdlSys calls FLDMMDL_BLACT_AddResByCode
 *     with the player's code), so the avatar is a second instance of a
 *     texture that is already there.
 *
 * The seam
 * -------
 *
 * The port needs the game data to reach the entity pool: the pool hangs
 * off it (GAME_DATA_GetOccupyInfo 0x02012964 answers the same object the
 * field map uses).  The port binds it wherever it binds it for the state
 * calls (bw_mod_state_set_game_data); the export service has the same
 * seam (sdk/mod_export.c).  Every game function below is declared weak,
 * the way sdk/mod_state.c declares them, so a link without the game still
 * succeeds and a call without the game reports nothing instead of calling
 * into nothing.
 *
 * The handles
 * -----------
 *
 * The handle of an avatar is the port's own number: the slot in the
 * port's table and the generation of that slot, so a handle the port has
 * given out is never mistaken for another one.  The record of the game is
 * not kept: the port finds it again through the object's id, so nothing
 * here assumes that a pointer fits in a u32, and a record the game has
 * deleted is never written to.
