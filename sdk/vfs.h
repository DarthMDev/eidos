/*
 * sdk/vfs.h -- the file layer's mod list and member-level NARC overrides.
 *
 * sdk/port.h declares the two roots and the path resolution every loader
 * uses (bw_set_data_root, bw_set_mod_root, bw_data_path); this header is the
 * rest of the file layer: several mods in a load order, and the merged view
 * of an archive some of whose members a mod replaces or adds.  README.md,
 * "The file layer", is the user-facing description of the mod tree.
 *
 * The model, in one paragraph.  There is one base layer (the data root) and
 * zero or more mod roots in a load order; a later mod wins over an earlier
 * one.  A NitroFS path `rel` resolves, at file granularity, to the latest
 * layer holding a regular file at `rel` (bw_data_path).  On top of that file,
 * every later mod that holds a *directory* at `rel` contributes members: a
 * file `<mod>/<rel>/<index>[.<ext>]` replaces member `index`, or adds it if
 * the archive is shorter, and later mods win over earlier ones for the same
 * index.  The result is synthesised as a whole NARC in memory and every
 * reader (the FS shim, the matched readers, sdk/narc.c) sees only that.

 * A mod root is a directory laid out like the data root.  It may hold a
 * manifest, `eidos_mod.txt`, of `key = value` lines (`#` starts a comment,
 * unknown keys are ignored so later versions can add some):
 *
 *     name  = Fairy type        # shown by tools; default: the directory name
 *     order = 10                # load order key, a signed integer; default 0
 *
 * Mods load in ascending `order`; mods with equal `order` keep the order
 * they were added in.  A later mod wins.
 *
 * bw_set_mod_root (sdk/port.h) replaces the whole list with the roots in its
 * argument, which may name several separated by ';' (the separator on every
 * host, since a Windows drive letter uses ':').  BW_MOD_ROOT is parsed the
 * same way the first time the list is consulted, unless a call came first.
 * bw_add_mod_root appends one root and re-sorts.  Every change drops the
 * cached merged archives (bw_vfs_flush).
 *
 * The order above is the mod author's: it is the manifest's `order` key.
 * The player may want another one, because the order the mods load in is
 * the order their overrides and their rules take effect.  bw_mod_set_order
 * is the seam for that: "this list, in this order".
