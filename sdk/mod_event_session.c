/*
 * sdk/mod_event_session.c -- the session area's event rows: the new game,
 * the three save events, the Hall of Fame, the badge, the event flag and
 * the Pokedex (docs/mod-events.md, section 1, "Session" and "Progress";
 * docs/mod-implementation.md, section 1, "The binding table"; the payloads
 * are docs/mod-payloads.md, section 2).
 *
 * One row per stable-event binding of this area.  A row names the game
 * function the event fires from (the region and the address of
 * mod/declared_set.txt), the event, the point, the scope, the builder that
 * fills the payload from the call, the applier that writes the modifiable
 * fields back and the refusal function that produces the refused outcome.
 * The dispatch core reads the rows from the table this file publishes
 * (bw_event_bindings_session) and registers them with
 * bw_mod_event_bind_area.
 *
 * The rules the port keeps (docs/mod-payloads.md, section 0): the port owns
 * the payload; a field is filled from the call's arguments, from an accessor
 * call at the slot or from a context; a field the call cannot supply stays
 * 0 and says so in a comment; a field that points at memory the game frees
 * later is copied into the payload, never stored as a pointer.
 *
 * The two save rows are more than payloads: they are the port's own save
 * window (docs/mod-state.md, section 2).  The game's save.begin opens the
 * window, in which the port's own save state is read and its checksum
 * taken, and the game's save.done closes it, in which the mod's own files
 * are written with the checksum of the save the game has just written.  The
 * window is therefore the game's own save and not the menu's apply, and a
 * mod's own file is written only when the game saved.
 *
 * The game's own accessors are declared under the names src/game gives
 * them, the way sdk/mod_state.c does: the port's older address spellings
 * are redirected onto the same names by the build's gamespell header
 * (tools/gamespell.py), so one spelling links against either tree.
