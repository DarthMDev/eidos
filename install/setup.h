/*
 * install/setup.h -- where the data root lives, whether it is usable, and
 * the first-run decisions that need no window.
 *
 * install.h turns a ROM into an extraction; this decides where that
 * extraction goes and whether the one already there can be played, and it
 * is what every front end asks first:
 *
 *   - the locations: the eidos home folder per platform (Local AppData on
 *     Windows, Application Support on macOS and iOS, $XDG_DATA_HOME on
 *     Linux, the app's internal storage on Android), the extraction inside
 *     it, the config file beside it, and portable mode (a portable.txt
 *     beside the executable puts all three there instead);
 *   - the resolution order of docs/installer.md: --data-root, then the
 *     BW_DATA_ROOT environment variable, then the folder saved in the
 *     config file, then the platform default;
 *   - the check: an extraction is playable when its eidos_manifest.json
 *     names this installer version and a known good dump, and the files
 *     the engine opens first are there;
 *   - the command-line path that skips the wizard (--rom), the headless
 *     answer when there is no window (--no-window), and the two
 *     maintenance commands (--reset-data, --move-data).
 *
 * Nothing here draws.  The SDL wizard (engine/platform/wizard.h) is what
 * a windowed build runs when bw_setup_prepare says the data is missing;
 * it calls back into this file to remember what it installed.  Paths are
 * UTF-8 everywhere, as in install.h.  The operating-system calls (the
 * known folders, the executable's own folder, the wide environment and
 * command line on Windows) are in install/location.c.
