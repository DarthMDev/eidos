/*
 * stubs/reimpl_vm_control.c -- the port's own copy of the script VMs'
 * dispatch, with the mod layer's script command hook in it.
 *
 * docs/mod-implementation.md, section 5 ("The script command hooks");
 * docs/mod-events.md, section 5 ("Script command hooks"); docs/hooks.md
 * ("Code hooks"); docs/game-tree.md (how the src/game tree is cut).
 *
 * The game's script VM (src/game/arm9/vm.c in the src/game tree,
 * src/matched/arm9/unit_0201126C.c in the matched one) dispatches every
 * command through one table: VM_Control (0x02011298) fetches a u16 opcode,
 * bounds-checks it against the VM's command count and calls the table's
 * entry for it.  Two VMs run it: the field script VM (609 commands,
 * d_0217062C, ov010) and the battle effect VM (78 commands, g_02209E88,
 * ov094).  The trainer AI's VM (ov096) and the station act script's VM
 * (ov132) run the same dispatch over tables of their own, and the port
 * leaves those two alone.
 *
 * How this file takes the game's place
 * ------------------------------------
 * This file defines the game's own name, VM_Control.  In the src/game
 * tree the boot plan (tools/bootlink.py's plan_game) knows every name the
 * eidos library defines -- this file is one of them -- and cuts those
 * definitions out of the game's own unit (tools/gamecut.py, through
 * tools/dsaddr.py's --cut-list, the list boot_cuts.txt); the port's file
 * is then the only VM_Control in the link.  Only that one function moves:
 * the rest of the game's unit (VM_Reset, VM_Create, VM_ReadU16, VM_GetU32,
 * the stack and the ring) stays where the game put it.
 *
 * What the port's dispatch does
 * -----------------------------
 * The one line that differs from the game's own code is the dispatch:
 *
 *     if (vm->params.cmds[op](vm, vm->user) == 1) {
 *         break;
 *     }
 *
 * becomes a call into the port's registry (sdk/mod_script.c), which runs
 * the mod's handlers for the opcode and then calls the game's own handler
 * -- wrapped, so that a handler which changed the command's operands has
 * them written back into the script before the game's handler reads them.
 *
 * What the port's view carries (sdk/mod_api.h, BwScriptCommand):
 *
 *   - the opcode;
 *   - the operands, as words: the command's operand bytes, little-endian,
 *     four to a word.  The game's own handler reads its operands off the
 *     same cursor, a u16 or a u32 at a time in its own order, so the
 *     view's bytes are the operand area itself and write back exactly.  The
 *     view holds the operands as bytes, sixty of them, which is the widest
 *     command of the two tables (the battle effect VM's opcode 8, at 60
 *     bytes; the field VM's widest is 22), so every operand of every
 *     command is in the view and none of it stays the game's own;
 *   - the program counter: the port's own count of where the command sits
 *     in the script, a number and never a host pointer, so it reads the
 *     same at every pointer width.
 *
 * What the port's dispatch answers:
 *
 *   - the game's own handler's answer: 1 ends the frame, as it does in
 *     the game's own code.  The port's own dispatch answers 0 or 1 for
 *     "replaced", which is a different thing, so the stand-in keeps the
 *     game's answer itself;
 *   - when a mod's handler replaced the command, the game's own handler
 *     never ran, so it never consumed the operands: the stand-in steps
 *     over them itself, and the frame goes on.  The game's own advance
 *     is the opcode's halfword plus the operands, which is what the
 *     view's next_pc says.
 *
 * The two VMs are told apart by the size of their command table
 * (bw_mod_script_vm_of): 609 is the field VM's, 78 the battle effect VM's.
 * Any other table is a VM the port does not touch, and the game's own
 * handler runs as it is.
