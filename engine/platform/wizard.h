/*
 * engine/platform/wizard.h -- the first-run setup window, and the one call
 * a front end makes before it starts the game.
 *
 * When the data root is missing or not playable (install/setup.h decides),
 * a windowed build opens this: one SDL window, drawn by eidos itself with
 * its own bitmap font (font.c), the same on every platform.  It says what
 * is needed, takes the ROM from the platform's file dialog
 * (install/picker.h) or from a file dropped on the window, checks it and
 * writes the game data on a worker thread with a progress bar and a
 * Cancel button, says in plain words why a file was refused (an archive,
 * another game, a damaged or modified dump), and hands back the ROM it
 * installed from.  docs/installer.md has the design.
 *
 * Every step is reachable from the keyboard (Enter, Escape, Tab, O) as well
 * as the mouse, and the window is testable without a display: under
 * SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy the config's `script` hook sees every frame (the
 * screen, its text, the button rectangles, the pixels) and pushes the
 * events a player would cause, and `pick` replaces the native dialog
 * (tests/test_wizard.c).
